    <pre style="margin-left: 200;">Virat Kohli is an Indian international cricketer 
    who plays Test and ODI cricket for the national team and is a former captain in all formats.

 Kohli received the Arjuna Award, India’s second highest sporting honor, from the government of India in 2013.
 In 2017 Kohli garnered the Padma Shri, India’s fourth highest civilian award. In 2018 he received the 
 Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award (now the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award), India’s highest sporting honor.
  A stand at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi was renamed after Kohli in 2019.</pre><br><br><br><br>

<p style="margin-left: 150;line-height: 1.5;margin-right: 120;text-align: justify;"> Kohli was appointed captain in 2013 and continued to lead RCB in the next eight seasons. 
    He was retained once again in 2014 for $1.6 million. In 2015 he moved up the order to open the batting,
     and his scores subsequently improved. The following year was a landmark season for him as he scored
      973 runs with 4 hundreds, earning the Orange Cap for leading run scorer that year, a single-season
       record he holds as of 2023. Unfortunately, RCB lost in the league final to the Sunrisers Hyderabad.</p>

    Kohli debuted in Tests later in 2011 against the West Indies, as players such as Sachin Tendulkar were 
    rested after the World Cup win. In the disastrous tour of Australia in 2011–12, India lost the Test series
     4–0, but Kohli scored the only century by an Indian player on the tour, earning praise.
